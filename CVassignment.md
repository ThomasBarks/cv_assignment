## PERSONAL STATEMENT
- - -

I am a relentlessly driven graduate currently seeking employment in the financial sector. Having possessed both a master’s and First Class bachelor’s degree in economics, I believe I have obtained a strong springboard for success within this industry. In addition, my achievements and interests outside of academia have helped mould me into a confident, intellectually curious individual. Such attributes, developed both in work and leisure, make me what I believe to be an ideal candidate for a role in which communication, analysis and leadership are paramount.
